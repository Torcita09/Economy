Ayon sa pag-aaral, isa sa bawat tatlong batang Pilipino ang nakararanas ng malnutrisyon at stunting. Bilang Mayor ng ating Probinsyudad, mahalaga sa akin na matiyak na ang mga kabataang Taguigeño ay may sapat na nutrisyon  dahil ito ang susi sa pag-abot ng kanilang maximum potential.<font face="Ariel" color="black">

Our student-athletes made history and brought home glory at the CARDINAL HEALTH INTERNATIONAL PHILIPPINES (Chip Spikers ODL) Volleyball Tournament held last June 21 at Magsaysay Covered Court, South Signal!</td>

This simple gesture of distribution was headed by PSDS Mrs. Rowena Roa, and Mr. Cipriano Bisco, Jr. who shows their unwavering dedication and commitment to the welfare of our students. </td></tr>

Even on a holiday, the spirit of bayanihan continues to shine!  Today marks a big step forward, all classrooms from every grade level are now fully prepared and ready to welcome our students back. Clean, organized, and filled with hope for the new school year!</td>
             <td>Bullying has no place in our schools, in our hearts, and in our community.

As the new school year starts, we stand together with one voice, one mission, and one goal — to create a safe and caring environment for every student. Through the Anti-Bullying and Child Protection Policy Campaign, we are reminded that no act of kindness is ever too small and no voice is ever too quiet when it speaks against injustice.</td></tr>
